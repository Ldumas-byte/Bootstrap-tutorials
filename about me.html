          The institution that trained me on Web development.
          I enrolled into the program through special voucher program under UCAN, WIOA program.
          Iâ€™m proud for being able to train under Micro-Train.
          Not only they were able to provide me various resources, but were very kind and welcoming.
          My councilors helped through the process and gave me all the support I needed.
          I was taught the basics of Ubuntu linux, shell commands, github, HTML, CSS, Javascript,
          Node.Js/Express module, Angular, Ionic, VSC, ApacheCordova, Mongo database, LAMP Stack.

        This was a very basic yet important office job.

        I found the job very valuable for future employments since it taught me the basics of office work environment.
        Having office is important since the office is core environment in industry.
        It is expected that a good employee knows how to operation equipment, sort and order papers, and interact with
        other in a professional matter.
        This was also provided to me by UCAN.

  I'm Lamarr Dumas.
  Welcome to my personal portfolio website.
  This website will help guide any business professional on my background and personal achievements.
  My goal is to connect myself with employers seeking upcoming web developers like myself.
  I found that making a website for me is the best way to express myself.
  I was inspired to make this site as a project as a final project for my web development course at Micro-train.
  This is show my skills off in making a website using HTML and my own custom CSS.
  My mission was to web design using the base tool of CSS so I can see how far I can go without using things like
  bootstrap.
  For the time being, this is a W.I.P, so things aren't too pretty.
  However, I want to improve more on this site in the future due to how fun it was.
  I'll get rid of my restriction bootstrap in the future and I'll try my hand using Javascript as well.
